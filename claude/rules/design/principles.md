# Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns** – One thing, one responsibility.
2. **Abstraction** – Hide complexity, expose intent.
3. **Explicit over Implicit** – No hidden dependencies, no magic.
4. **Fast Feedback** – If you can't observe it, you can't improve it.
5. **Design for Change** – Make decisions reversible and costs of change low.
6. **Simplicity** – Do not build what is not needed; prefer the least complex solution that works.
7. **Consistency** – Same problem, same solution; minimize surprise.
