# Design Principles

1. **Simplicity** - Do not build what is not needed; prefer the least complex solution that works.
2. **Separation of Concerns** - One thing, one responsibility.
3. **Abstraction** - Hide complexity, expose intent.
4. **Explicit over Implicit** - No hidden dependencies, no magic.
5. **Single Source of Truth** - Define every piece of knowledge exactly once.
6. **Design for Change** - Make decisions reversible and costs of change low.
7. **Predictability** - Same input, same result; same problem, same solution. Minimize surprise.
8. **Fast Feedback** - If you can't observe it, you can't improve it.
